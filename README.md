# ACCL: A Plug-and-Play Adaptive Confusion-Aware Contrastive Loss for UAV-to-Satellite Geolocalization

Welcome to the official repository for our ICME-accepted paper:

**"ACCL: A Plug-and-Play Adaptive Confusion-Aware Contrastive Loss for UAV-to-Satellite Geolocalization."**

This repository contains training and inference code for ACCL, a novel loss function designed to enhance contrastive learning by adapting to confusion in UAV-to-satellite retrieval tasks.

## ACCL Framework

![ACCL Architecture](figs/fig2.png)

> Our method consists of three core modules:
> 1. **Hard Negative Sampling Module**: Reorganizes input query images, gathering similar pairs together.
> 2. **Feature Extraction Module**: Extracts deep representations using a shared-weight neural network.
> 3. **Adaptive Confusion-Aware Contrastive Loss Module**: Computes ACCL based on extracted features and confusion measured via a confusion matrix function.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NWPU-CPS/ACCL.git
   cd ACCL
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Training & Evaluation

Before Running, You need to change the path in the cfgops/{dataset_name}/*.py, which describe the data path and model output path.

Run the main script:
```bash
python jupiter.py
```

For each dataset, execute the corresponding configuration script. Pre-trained weights should be placed in the appropriate `cfops/` directory before running evaluation scripts.
